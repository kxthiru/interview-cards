    "Answer": "D/E = 50% implies that the company is financed with 1/3rd debt, and 2/3rds equity. Hence, WACC = (1/3) * cost of debt + (2/3) * cost of equity. Plugging in the given values, we have 12% = (1/3) * 7% + (2/3) * cost of equity. This gives us a cost of equity of [12% - (1/3) * 7%] / (2/3) = 14.5%."

WACC reflects the time value of money as well as the return that investors must require in order to invest in an investment or project.

    "Answer": "Company A’s EPS is $100 / 40 = $2.50. To do the deal, Company A must issue ($20 * 50) / $25 = 40 shares, so the Combined Share Count is 40 + 40 = 80.

    "Answer": "The company is bought for $20 * 9 = $180 with $180 * 2/3 = $120 of debt and $60 of equity. The company is sold for $30 * 9 = $270. The sponsor’s exit equity = $270 – ($120 - $30) = $180. MOIC is $180 / $60 = 3x which corresponds to a ~25% IRR."

    "Question": "A company buys back stock by raising Cash via Debt. How does this transaction affect Enterprise Value, Equity Value, and P/E.",
    "Answer": "Assume the company's stock price remains constant. Given the number of shares outstanding has decreased, Equity Value decreases. Enterprise Value is unchanged as Equity Value decreases by the same amount that Debt increases, while Cash remains the same. As shares outstanding decreases, EPS (Net Income / Shares Outstanding) has increased, meaning P/E decreased."

    "Question": "Company A trades at $2 per share, a P/E of 1x, and has 100 shares outstanding. Company B trades at $3 per share, a P/E of 1x, and has 100 shares outstanding. Company A buys Company B, offering $4 per share that is 50% cash (financed through Debt) and 50% stock. The Cost of Debt is 5% and matures over 5 years. There is $10 in financing fees and $10 in deal fees. Is this acquisition accretive or dilutive?",
    "Answer": "Assume a 40% Tax Rate and constant Net Income for both companies in the future.\nCompany B is acquired for $4 * 100 = $400, using $200 of Cash and issuing $200 of Equity. $200 / $2 = 100 shares are issued. There are $10 + $10 = $20 of total fees, which is assumed to be paid with existing Cash on hand.\nCompany A’s Net Income is ($2 * 100) / 1x = $200. Company B Net Income is ($3 * 100) / 1x = $300. Year 1 Pro-forma Net Income is $200 + $300 – ($200 * 5%) * (1 – 0.4) - $20 * (1 – 0.4) = $482. Hence, Year 1 EPS is $482 / 200 = $2.41.\nYear 2-5 Pro-forma Net Income is $200 + 300 - ($200 * 5%) * (1 – 0.4) = $494. Hence, Year 2-5 EPS is $2.47. Year 6 and onwards Net Income is $200 + $300 = $500. Hence, EPS is $500 / 200 = $2.50.\nGiven Company A’s EPS is 2 / 1x = $2.00, this deal is accretive in all years."

    "Answer": "IS: Revenue is up $400, COGS is up $200, and OpEx is up $100 so Operating Income is up by $400 - $200 - $100 = $100. Interest Expense is up $200 * 5% = $10 so Income Before Tax is $100 - $10 = $90. Assuming a 30% Tax Rate, Net Income is up $90 * (1 – 0.3) = $63.\nCFS: Net Income at the top is up $63. The decrease in inventory is a non-cash event so $200 is added back to CFO. CFF is down by $200 * 10% = $20, so Net Change in Cash is up by $63 + $200 - $20 = $243.\nBS: Cash is up $243 and Inventory is down $200, so Assets are up by $43. Debt is down $20 from the Principal Payment. Shareholders’ Equity is up by $63 from the increase in Retained Earnings. Change in Assets equals Change in Liabilities + Change in Shareholders’ Equity so the Balance Sheet balances."

    "Question": "Would a DCF or LBO give you a higher valuation on average?",

Because the sponsor is constrained by how much debt they can use and how much equity return they need, the maximum price they can pay — and therefore the valuation — tends to be lower.\n\nWhile both models account for cash flows over time, the DCF values them directly, whereas the LBO uses them to repay debt and generate equity value at exit. As a result, the LBO reflects a floor valuation — the minimum a private equity buyer could pay and still hit their return target."

    "Question": "How is WACC different for Tesla and Ford?",
    "Answer": "Tesla likely has a higher WACC than Ford due to key differences in their business risk, capital structure, and financing costs. Tesla operates as a high-growth, innovation-driven company with more volatility in its stock price, leading to a higher beta and therefore a higher cost of equity. Additionally, Tesla historically had a lower credit rating and less predictable cash flows, which translated to a higher cost of debt, although this has improved over time. In contrast, Ford is a more mature and capital-intensive automaker with a stable revenue base and a long track record of accessing debt markets at relatively lower rates, especially through its financing arm, Ford Credit. Ford also uses a more debt-heavy capital structure, which benefits from the tax shield and further lowers its WACC. Ultimately, Tesla’s higher perceived risk and equity-heavy structure result in a higher weighted average cost of capital compared to Ford."

    "Question": "What is a company with zero beta?",
    "Answer": "A beta of zero indicates no correlation with broader market movements, meaning the asset's returns are unaffected by market volatility. The clearest example is short-term U.S. Treasury bills, which are considered risk-free and serve as the benchmark for zero-beta assets in models like CAPM. Some cash-equivalent instruments or money market funds may also approximate zero beta. In theory, even a company—such as a biotech firm developing a single drug—could exhibit near-zero beta if its valuation is driven entirely by binary outcomes like FDA approval, rather than macroeconomic factors. However, in practice, even these firms tend to show some correlation with market sentiment, especially during broad risk-on or risk-off shifts. True zero-beta investments are rare in the corporate world, as most companies are exposed in some way to systematic market risk."

    "Answer": "It is best practice to ask the interviewer for assumptions as you need them during this problem – instead we will assume 2 of D&A per year, 2 of CapEx per year, 50% tax rate, no interest expense, and no changes in net working capital.\n\nThe company is bought with 300 * 50% = 150 of Debt and 300 – 150 = 150 in Equity. The company has an EBITDA margin of 10 / 50 = 20%. Year 1 EBITDA is 12, Year 2 is 14, …, and Year 5 is 20. Subtracting D&A, Year 1 EBIT is 10, Year 2 EBIT is 12, …, and Year 5 EBIT is 18. With no interest expense (EBT = Net Income) and a 50% Tax Rate, Year 1 Net Income is 5, Year 2 Net Income is 6, …, and Year 5 Net Income is 9. We then add back D&A, subtract CapEx, and subtract changes in working capital each year to get FCF. Given D&A = CapEx and no changes in working capital, FCF = Net Income.\nAssuming all FCF is used to paydown Debt, we paydown 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 35 of Debt over the holding period. Given the company is sold at 400 EV, the company’s exit Equity is worth 400 – (150 – 35) = 285.\nHence, our MOIC is 285 / 150 = 1.9x (roughly 2x) which is a roughly 15% IRR over 5 years."

    "Answer": "Returns come from one of three areas in an LBO: 1) multiple expansion (i.e., lower the purchase price or raise the exit price), 2) leverage (i.e., increase the % of debt to equity used in the deal), and 3) EBITDA expansion (i.e., increase the company's top line revenue, growth rate, or reduce expenses)."

    "Answer": "Investments in Associates (equity method investments) represent ownership stakes in other companies, usually between 20–50%, where you have significant influence but not full control. Because you don’t consolidate the subsidiary’s financials, only your share of net income shows up on the income statement (below EBIT), and the investment itself shows up as a non-operating asset on the balance sheet.\n\nWhen calculating Enterprise Value (EV), you want to capture only the value of core operations available to all investors. Since Investments in Associates are non-core, non-operating assets, you need to subtract them from Enterprise Value if they’re included in Equity Value.\n\nEV = Equity Value + Net Debt + Preferred Stock + Non-Controlling Interests – Cash & Non-Operating Assets\n\nSo where do Investments in Associates fit? They are included in Equity Value (Market Cap)\nBecause when investors value the equity, they account for everything the company owns — including stakes in other businesses. So by definition, Equity Value already reflects those investments.\n\nBut they are non-operating\nThey don’t contribute to the company’s core operating performance, so if you want EV to represent just the operating business, you must subtract them (just like excess cash)."

    "Answer": "The company is bought at 50 * 10 = 500 purchase price, with 500 * 20% = 100 of debt and 400 of equity. At a 20% EBITDA margin, the company does 50 / 20% = 250 of revenue in year 1.\nWith 100 of non-widget revenue, the company sells widgets for (250-100) / 10 = $15.\nA 32% IRR over 5 years, equates to a 4x MOIC, meaning exit equity must be 400 * 4x = 1,600.

Hence the cost of debt that causes no dilution would be [(1 / 8) - 0.4 * (1 / 10)] / (0.6 * (1 - 0.4)) = (0.125 - 0.4* (0.1)) / (0.6 * 0.6) = 0.085 / 0.36 ≈ 0.24."

Instead, we should use an ARR multiple, specifically by applying the mean or median multiple of a basket of comparable Software companies.

    "Question": "When would an acquirer use equity in an acquisition and when would they use debt?",
    "Answer": "Debt financing is typically cheaper than issuing equity (cost of debt < cost of equity). Debt has tax benefits because the interest payments are tax deductible, and the increased leverage can also boost a company's return on equity. No new shares are issued so there is no dilution to current ownership. However, the issuance of too much debt will hurt a company's credit rating, which increases cost of debt and limits future ability to borrow.\n\nOn the other hand, acquirers may prefer to fund an acquisition via equity due to the increases flexibility – equity has no 1) mandatory interest payments, 2) principal that must be repaid, and 3) restrictive covenants related to its issuance. Issuing equity has no impact on credit rating. However, equity offerings may reduce EPS and return on equity as the company becomes less leveraged. Acquirers prefer to use equity when their stock price is \"expensive\", or the target's stock is \"cheap\" (and vice versa for when debt is preferred)."

    "Question": "Should Debt always be added to Equity Value when calculating Enterprise Value?",
    "Answer": "In almost all cases, yes. Debt typically has to be repaid or assumed by the acquirer, so it increases the effective price of the target.\nVery rare exceptions exist if the acquirer doesn't pay off the debt, but that's uncommon in M&A."

    "Answer": "RSUs are effectively common shares that vest, so you add them to the share count once they're granted.\nPerformance Shares convert if certain targets are met (e.g. share price, EPS), so you include them in the diluted count if they are in-the-money."

    "Answer": "Taxes hit both levers in a DCF. Decrease in taxes leads to a higher FCF (good) but also a higher WACC (bad), and vice-versa.\nFCF:\n• NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - T). Lower T 1 FCF; higher T v FCF.\nWACC:\n• Cost of Debt (CoD): Ka(1 - T). Lower T 1 after-tax Kd; higher T v it.\n• Cost of Equity (COE): BL = Bu * [1 + (1 - T) * D/E1.

    "Answer": "If the exit multiple contracts or business performance is weaker, the equity holders' upside may be minimal or negative.\nMeanwhile, debt investors receive steady interest payments and principal repayment, yielding a higher IRR if equity returns are lackluster."

    "Question": "Why might an LBO sponsor willingly pay a slightly higher purchase multiple if the financing is favorable?",
    "Answer": "Cheap financing (lower interest, flexible covenants) can offset a higher entry price, preserving or enhancing the sponsor's returns.\nIf the sponsor believes operational improvements or synergies will still drive strong IRR, they might pay up for a competitive asset."

    "Question": "Can you explain why a PE firm might maintain a minimum cash balance in an LBO model?",
    "Answer": "Companies need a buffer for operations and liquidity. You don't want to aggressively sweep all available cash for debt repayment and leave no operating cushion.\nThe model enforces a minimum so the company can function without borrowing for minor day-to-day expenses."

    "Question": "What are some common \"exit assumptions\" you would see in an LBO, and how do they affect returns?",
    "Answer": "You might assume an exit after 3-7 years at an EBITDA multiple similar to or higher/lower than purchase.\nChanges in exit multiple or timing directly affect the IRR; selling sooner or at a higher multiple generally yields higher returns."

    "Question": "If a PE firm invests $200 million of equity and sells the company for $400 million in equity value after 5 years, what's the approximate IRR, ignoring any cash flow distributions?",
    "Answer": "Doubling in 5 years is roughly a 15% IRR (actual is close to 14.9%).\nAs a rule of thumb, doubling in 3 years is ~26%, in 4 years ~19%, in 5 years ~15%, and in 6 years ~12%."

    "Question": "What is a \"stub period\" in an LBO model, and how do you handle it?",
    "Answer": "A stub period is a partial year between closing and the company's fiscal year-end.\nYou adjust interest and debt paydown calculations proportionally. For instance, if it's a 3-month stub, you accrue a quarter's interest expense and partial principal repayment."

    "Question": "Why might a mezzanine investor accept equity \"kickers\" or warrants in an LBO?",

    "Question": "How does a \"management rollover\" of equity affect the purchase price and IRR in an LBO?",
    "Answer": "Management reinvests a portion of their existing equity into the new structure at closing, reducing the net equity the PE firm must fund.\nThis can improve IRR since less new equity is contributed, but management also shares in the eventual upside at exit."

    "Question": "Can the IRR in an LBO model reach extremely high levels if the holding period is very short?",

All debt is covered, leaving 1x EBITDA for equity.\nExit at 8x EBITDA: the 8x sale value exactly equals total debt (3x senior + 5x junior).
