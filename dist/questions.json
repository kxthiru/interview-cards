    "Question":"A company has a WACC of 13%, a post-tax cost of debt of 7%, and a debt-to-equity ratio of 50%. Calculate the company’s cost of equity.",
    "Answer":"D\/E = 50% implies that the company is financed with 1\/3rd debt, and 2\/3rds equity. Hence, WACC = (1\/3) * cost of debt + (2\/3) * cost of equity. Plugging in the given values, we have 12% = (1\/3) * 7% + (2\/3) * cost of equity. This gives us a cost of equity of [12% - (1\/3) * 7%] \/ (2\/3) = 14.5%."

    "Question":"What is WACC?",
    "Answer":"WACC = Cost of Equity * (% Equity) + Cost of Debt * (% Debt) * (1 – Tax Rate), where Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta * Equity Risk Premium).\n\nWACC is the discount rate at which we discount unlevered cash flows. WACC reflects the time value of money as well as the return that investors must require in order to invest in an investment or project. WACC represents the “risk” of a company; higher WACC means higher risk."

    "Answer":"As Company A has lower net income (top of the CFS), it has less cash flow. There will be no differences to cash flow from operations or investing.

Assuming a 20% tax rate, net income is down by $40 * ( 1 – 0.2) = $32.\nYear 1 CFS: Net income at the top is down by $32 and $40 in depreciation is added back in CFO, which leaves cash at the bottom up by $8.\nYear 1 BS: On the asset side, cash is up by $8 and PP&E is down by $40, so assets are net down by $32. No changes to liabilities. Shareholder’s equity is down by $32 from the reduction in retained earnings."

    "Answer":"Given Company A’s P\/E ratio is less than Company B’s P\/E ratio, the deal will be dilutive.\n\nThe exact numbers follow: Company A’s EPS is $50\/10 = $5. To do the deal, Company A must issue ($40*125)\/$50 = 100 shares. Company A’s Net Income (Market Cap \/ P\/E) is $50*300\/10 = $1,500. Company B’s Net Income is $40*125\/15 = $333. So, the Combined Share Count is 300 + 100 = 400 and the Combined Net Income is $1,500 + $333 = $1,833.\nTherefore, the combined EPS is $1,833 \/ 400 = $4.58, which is dilutive."

If all else is equal between these two companies (same growth rate, margin profile, and risk profile), then we would prefer to buy the company that trades at a 5x multiple given it is undervalued relative to the 10x company.\n\nHowever, most likely the 10x company has some attractive characteristics that the 5x company does not have. Examples include greater scale or maturity, better margins, and a growth rate. Hence it depends on whether we are more of a growth or value investor."

    "Answer":"Company A’s EPS is $100 \/ 40 = $2.50. To do the deal, Company A must issue ($20 * 50) \/ $25 = 40 shares, so the Combined Share Count is 40 + 40 = 80. The Combined Net Income is $100 + $40 = $140. Therefore, the Combined EPS is $140 \/ 80 = $1.75, so the deal is dilutive by ($2.50 - $1.75) \/ $2.50 = 30%."
